# Knowledge resources - My personal collection
The following is a collection of books, academic papers, blog posts, videos and courses I
have consumed over the years and found insightful. The topics mostly involve ML, ML-Ops and software development in general.
I have tried to provide a source for most resources, but some books/courses are not available for free.
